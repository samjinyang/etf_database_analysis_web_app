# ETF Database Analysis

## *Introduction*

This project will create a **Jupyter notebook** that holds analsysis information on an ETF portfolio.  This analysis will interact with a lot of **SQL databases** by using **SQL queries** to be read into **Pandas Dataframes**.

---

## Technologies

**Python 3.7.9** was used to code this program, and the code is held in a **Jupyter Notebook** file.  The Python libararies that have been utilized to make this program possible are: **Pandas, Numpy, hvplot, SQLAlchemy, and  Voilà.**

---

## Installation Guide

Since this is a **Jupyter Notebook** file, please open **Jupyter Lab** to run this file.

---

## Usage & Examples

This program will use **SQL queries** to be read into **Pandas Dataframes**:

We will be using **hvplot** from the **Pandas** library to create interactive plots for our analysis:

---

Multiple **SQL tables** will be joined using **inner join** to create a more comprehensive **DataFrame** to plot for the analysi:

---

The final part of this analysis will involve using **Voilà** to launch the notebook in a web application for a cleaner visualization.  This is done through the **command line/terminal**, going to the directory where the **Jupyter notebook** is help, and then typing in **voila (name of Jupyter notebook)**.  You should see something like the following:
